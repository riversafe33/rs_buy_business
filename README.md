Script Description:

This script manages the buying, selling, and transferring of businesses in a RedM server using the VORP framework. 
Players can purchase businesses by paying a set price, which assigns them a specific job and job grade associated with the business. 
Ownership data is stored and retrieved from a database to keep track of which player owns which business.

Key features include:

Loading business ownership data on server start and player connect.

Allowing players to buy businesses if they have enough money and do not already own one.

Allowing owners to sell their business for a partial refund (60% of the price).

Allowing owners to transfer their business to another player who does not already own a business.

Syncing business ownership updates to all connected clients.

Notifications to players about successful transactions or error messages.

Once you have purchased a business, you will only see the prompt for the business you own
and you will no longer see the prompts for available businesses until you sell or transfer your ownership.
